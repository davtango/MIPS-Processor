# MIPS-Microprocessor-Project
After reviewing digital design concepts by reading a textbook, I decided it would be useful to implement a microprocessor in SystemVerilog and then verify its functionality to better understand how it works. 

The textbook "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by David Money Harris &amp; Sarah L. Harris provides microarchitecture designs for a single-cycled, a multi-cycled, and a pipelined MIPS processor with only HDL code for the single-cycled processor available (with said code sporting limited support for instructions). The HDL code implementation of the other two microarchitectures was left as an exercise to the reader.

My goal for this project is to implement both their presented multi-cycled and pipelined processor designs in SystemVerilog and produce test benches to verify their functionality.

In this folder there will be three folders for each micro-architecture: Single-cycled, Multi-cycled, and Pipelined. The single-cycled folder will contain mostly reference HDL code from the textbook which I will use as a starting point.
